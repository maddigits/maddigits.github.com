title: "Running a Selenium Grid with docker-compose"
---

At [ContaAzul](http://contaazul.com), we had 31 Windows machines powering our
Selenium tests - one running the grid and 30 more running clients. Needless
to say, this is **very** expensive.

As we are already using [Docker](http://docker.io/) to run our builds (on
[Shippable](http://shippable.com)), we decided to try it out to run Selenium
tests too.

It was no surprise that Selenium guys already made a ready-to-go set of Docker
images. There is an image for the Selenium Grid itself, and the browser images -
Chrome and Firefox, also with debug versions - which allow you to access them
using VNC to _"see what's happening there"_. You can check them out in their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium).

## Making it work

Basically, I created a `c3.4xlarge` EC2 machine and installed both
Docker and docker-compose, following their respective README's:

```sh
# install docker:
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

# install docker-compose:
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.2.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

With docker up and running, I created a simple `docker-compose.yml` file, which
describes my containers and how they interact with each other. It ended up
being something like this:

```yaml
hub:
  image: selenium/hub
  ports:
    - "4444:4444"
firefox:
  image: selenium/node-firefox
  links:
    - hub
chrome:
  image: selenium/node-chrome
  links:
    - hub
```

This uses only the very basics of docker-compose syntax. You can always take a
look at the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to learn a bit
more about it.

Now, we can start the service running:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

After that, it is just a matter of telling the selenium test runner to connect
on the Docker host machine on port `4444` and everything will just work.

But, well, we had 30 machines before... now I only have 2 selenium instances
running (one with Firefox and the other with Chrome). How can I fix that?
Well, I'm glad you asked:

```sh
docker-compose scale chrome=15 firefox=15
```

Around 10 seconds later, 30 selenium instances up and running. **Sweet**.

## Let's talk money

![show me the money gif](/public/images/show-me-the-money.gif)

The objective was to decrease our costs with EC2 instances in our development
VPC.

With this changes, we dropped our monthly EC2 billing related to Selenium
by ~**77%**! Ok, ok, we have also changed the main OS where the tests run on.
Well, even if the instances were already running on Linux boxes before, it
would still be something a cut of ~**57%**. And I'm not even counting
the EBS volumes!

Well, **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**.

> 50% usage is because we only use them about 12 hours per day (business hours,
give or take).

## Try it out

In order to make it easier for you guys to put all this to work (save you
a bunch of copy-and-paste combos), I created a simple set of shell scripts that
can easily put a selenium grid up and running.

To test that, you can start a fresh linux machine (or not, your call) and hit:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/caarlos0/selenium-grid-on-docker.git && \
  cd selenium-grid-on-docker && \
  sudo ./install.sh
```

This will download the scripts and install docker and docker compose. When you
install Docker, it will suggest you to add your user to the `docker` group.
You should really do that. I help you, it's something like this:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker your-username
```

Now, let's put it to run:

```sh
./run.sh
```

This command will pull and run 3 containers: hub, firefox and chrome. You can
scale things up with:

```sh
./scale.sh 10
```

This will scale the grid to 10 Chrome containers and 10 Firefox containers
(be advised that it will eat a lot memory - it's 10 browsers, after all).

On my Mac, I scaled it to 4 Chrome and 4 Firefox instances, it looked like:

![Running 4 Firefox and 4 Chrome instances on my laptop](/public/images/docker-on-my-machine-scale-4.png)

Just 5 seconds to start 8 containers. _Neat_.

## Conclusions

**Docker is great!** (I can't say this enough)

Some people don't yet trust Docker enough to put it in production, or are
scared of it because of the lack of knowledge. I can only suggest you to
start testing it in development machines, CI environments and so forth. It is
safe and you will surely learn a lot (and love almost every second of it).

The best part: need more speed? Just change the instance type and let
docker-compose scale it up!
The other best part (yes there is more than one): you can put 30 Selenium
machines to run in a few seconds. Try that with 30 Windows machines.

## Future

Maybe autoscale the cluster using spot instances?
