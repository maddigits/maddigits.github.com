title: "One more process might not be the right answer"

Don't get me wrong, I do believe that some set of basic rules must exist.
What I don't believe is that they are the only way of fixing things.

> Warning: this article will contain some philosophical and economics
boring stuff.

## Introduction

I would like to start my rationale with a quote about politics
I recently found which I think applies perfectly to this scenario:

![The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws. - Tacitus](/public/images/the more corrupt the state the more numerous the laws.jpg)

I think we can interpret this as something like

> Laws are only needed when values are not present.

Given some thought, that might sound a little harsh, but, let's explore
the subject.

## Values and Economics

A well known example of absence of values is the Brazilian "culture".
Here, we have a law for almost every stupid possible corner case of almost
any stupid thing any stupid human being might want to do. The result is a
book of laws that no one really knows nor fully understand, full
of "design flaws" "hacked" to innocent bad people - or worse.

Those laws exist mostly because it's common here to take shortcuts
to do stuff (like stealing other people).
Looking for the bright side, people can be really
creative. The other side is that a lot of people use that
creativity to do bad things.

Giving this lack of good citizen
values in Brazilian culture in general - which is extended to the
government, we end up having a lot of laws.

This issue is also addressed in a economics book from 1944, written by
Friedrich Hayek, called
["The Road of Serfdom"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226320553/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226320553&linkCode=as2&tag=carlbeck-20&linkId=GWMI44FYUFMMSGRJ):

> (...) De Tocqueville's prediction of the "new kind of servitude" when
after having thus successively taken each member of the community in its
powerful grasp, and fashioned him at will, the supreme power then extends
its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of society with
a network of small complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which
the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate
to rise above the crowd. The will of man is not shattered but softened,
bent and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are
constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but
it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses,
enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is
reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid and industrial
animals, of which government is the shepherd.

That's exactly what how it feels in Brazil, and,
if you ignore the government part, this can be applied to almost anything -
including industry. I worked for a company that make me feel that way too.
That rules were necessary, mostly, because, well... people suck.

## The People

It seems obvious to me that we, as an industry, must focus on improve the
people, not the process or the tools.

After all, programming is still considered by many people as a creative
process, like an art or a craft. How can an artist or a craftsman do
"their thing" if they cannot clear their minds because of a
"network of small complicated rules" above them clouding their judgment?

David West also wrote about this in his book,
["Object Thinking"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619654&linkCode=as2&tag=carlbeck-20&linkId=YOAGPVXGOZL2DKWY).
He defends that the solution is, in fact, better people. His writing
is way better than mine, so, I will just quote him:

> "Better people" has been recognized as the most promising silver bullet
for addressing the software crisis, and yet almost all of our energy has
been spent on creating better tools, methods, and processes instead of
better people?

And, well, there is XP with pair programming and other techniques that
are made to, in the end, improve the people.

## Values, again

But, what does "better people" even mean? For me, values. Let's go
back to the citizen example. One might say that
to have good values as a citizen is to be honest, to follow and respect
the laws, to respect other citizens and the authorities and to
contribute to the country in some way.

I like to think that, to have good values as a developer is
to take responsibility for your own mistakes, to want someone to
review your code because you know you are not perfect and might as well
commit mistakes like anyone else, to know that, like a musician, you are
not paid to practice, but to create value to their customers, and,
maybe more that anything else, to always want to improve as a
human being and as a professional.

That last one is the most important
for me, because, if you want to improve, you will find a way to
acquire knowledge, which is also necessary to be a good professional.
In this way, if don't have the required knowledge to do some task,
but have the values, you will find a way. That's better than having
the knowledge - or worse, believe in that without really having, and
for example, point fingers to someone else when you do something wrong.

For me it's plain simple: `good values = good people`.

## Rules... and Scrum

I do think that some rules are needed. Even open source projects usually
have some set of basic rules to maintain the order, like, tabs or spaces,
80c, naming patterns and so on. They usually don't, thought, have a set
of complicated rules that predict how to port yourself in front of all
possible situations.

I like to think that good rules can be automated and almost everything else
is secondary. That's why I don't like Scrum that much. For me, it's
a good tool to improve one or more aspects of a given team.

For example, if the team don't talk to each other as much as they should,
by adding "rules" - or ceremonies, if you like, like daily meetings, Scrum
can induce the team to create the culture of talking, until they are
mature enough to realize that the ceremony itself is now useless - even if it
was necessary one time.

This is nothing more than a "hotfix" to the real problem:
the team doesn't talk to each other as they should. Remember the very first
item of the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/):
"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools". Scrum is just
a tool. Focus more on "Individuals and interactions" than
"processes and tools".

## The People, again

Remember that CASE tools which were promised to allow anyone to create a
software by dragging some arrows and boxes? Just a few millions of
dollars spent in the wrong problem.

That's why there were that flaming posts like
["Agile Is Dead (Long Live Agility)"](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/).
That's also why - I believe, Uncle Bob, after publishing the
["Clean Code"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=carlbeck-20&linkId=M5YAXQCRGWV37R22),
published the
["Clean Coder"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=carlbeck-20&linkId=VC6WP7H543ZXMOK7),
which focus in improving people behavior as professionals rather than the
code they write. I also like to think that that's why Agile was created,
and, ironically, was corrupted into a set of certifications and tools.

That's why, after the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)
and its "Individuals and interactions" thing, the
["Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship"](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
was created, stating, among other things,
"Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of
professionals". I believe that the main focus of a community
of professionals is - or at least should be, to share knowledge and
experiences between their members, so everyone can improve as a
professional.

## Finishing

Creating a new process is usually easier than fixing the real
problem. It also gives you a sense of accomplishment quickly than fixing
the real problem - if ever - would. That's probably why there are more
work related to fixing tools and processes than focusing in improving
people who uses them.

That said, I would like to recommend you something: as a team member, doesn't
matter in which role, think twice before adding that new "simple
process" to your already existing set of processes. Do a root cause analysis
of the problem, find the real issue and act on that. Maybe you can also
do that in the already created processes and find if there is something
that can be removed. Do a "clean code" in your processes. Sometimes the
root cause will be just the lack of knowledge.
Other times lack of communication. It might even be a one-time
thing that - by definition - will never happen again. Let me know what you
discover.
