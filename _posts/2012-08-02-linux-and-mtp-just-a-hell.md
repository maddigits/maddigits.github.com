title: "Linux and MTP: Just a hell"
---

Recently I bought a Samsung Galaxy X phone (brazilian Nexus). Yeah, it is a
pretty cool device, fast, etc etc... oh, yep, a little expensive too...

I was pretty happy with it, until I tried to copy some files to it
(basically, music). Then, I discover that nexus android force you to use
something called
[MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol).
According to them, this decision is to made android better, but, I believe
that force the user to use it, is not.

User who use Linux, Mac OS and Windows XP have to install additional
packages/softwares to put it to work. And the worst part is that installing
these additional softwares not solve the problem at all.

I end up with a tecnical easy solution for arch linux, after follow a
thousand tutorials.

## The **UGLY** solution

* Get
[this package (android-udev)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=51476)
from aur. (it will install libmtpfs and all other deps)
* Install **gvfs-gphoto2** via pacman.
* Reboot

  **PS**: If you have yaourt, you can do all this with one command:

```bash
yaourt -S android-udev gvfs-gphoto2 --noconfirm
```

Then, if you have some luck, you can connect you device via some media player
(I used [clementine](http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/)) and copy at
least some music to your device.

Also, you can transfer files via bluetooth (hell slow) or via wireless
(using something like
[airdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid)).

I'll try to mantain this post updated with new info, if you have something to
share, please leave a comment.

See ya.
