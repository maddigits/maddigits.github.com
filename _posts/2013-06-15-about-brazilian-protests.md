title: "About the Brazilian Protests"
---

It's now well known in media that, we, brazilian people, were facing our
government for a lot of things, the most well known one, R$ 0,20 increase in
the bus ticket in São Paulo.

Well, let's say that this was only the last drop in São Paulo, which made almost
all people fight for it too and all other shit too.

![rights, not cents][rights]

> It's not for cents, it's for **rights**.

Believe you or not, my grandmother is right now, in some city in Mato Grosso
do Sul, protesting about something here called FUNAI, which, in theory,
should defend the indians rights. These motherfuckers want to **give** a lot of
the south brazilian area to them, even if them aren't living in these places
for more than **50 years**. You might be thinking that the government will
then give these people some area to live after all this, right? **NO**. They
will remove lots of families which work, produces food. A lot of them lived
their entire life in a damn small farms, with familiar agriculture, but they
don't care.

You think that I'm overreacting? Look at this map:

![map][map]

Basically, they want to **give** all this collored areas to the indians. The
big green one at the bottom is one of the newest and biggest one. But the
protests are not just about that.

Here in Brazil, we have something called "Rede Globo de Televisão", a TV
channel, which basically do what they want, manipulating people so they
just sit and watch some stupid TV show, while the politicians "walk and shit"
where, how and how much they want.

They **ROB US EVERY FUCKING DAY**. We pay more than half that we earn in taxes.
And we get NOTHING BACK.

Public education, health and security are almost the same as nothing. In few
words, we pay taxes to have them, but we end up paying to have them, and we
have to pay embedded taxes to get this too.

We got tired of this crap. There are people starving, and they spent **R$ 1.2
BILLION** in a fucking football stadium in a city that doesn't even have
a big football team.

## That's unbelievable. That's unacceptable.

We are tired. Really, really tired. We can't take all this crap and stay still
anymore. That's only the tip of the iceberg about why we are protesting,
why we are going to the street next thuesday, 20/jun to protest again about it,
and **WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEY START TO FIX THIS**. Maybe the army should
rule for a while.

![it is not the 20 cents][20cents]

> It is not the **20 cents**.

> It is **500** years of governments rapping the people...

> **Marchers** of the entire country, you are **heroes**. We will never let the
> **accommodated and alienated** people say the opposite.


## Can I help, even if I'm in/from other country?

Yes, you can! As the video says, we are attracting a lot of attention right now,
because of the FIFA Worldcup and shit, so, you can help us. Help us share
all of this crap, protest where you live, whatever you could do surelly will
help us.

Brazilian government just change the laws to be able to do what they want
believing that nothing will happen to them, and we didn't do anything
about it, because our people was disunited so far, for some reason, that
seems to start to fade away, but I'm afraid that it will end up with a civil
war, which we surelly don't want. We will protest peacefully as much as we
can, and you could help us.

Let's change Brazil! Thank you all for any help and support!
