title: "Riding a MS Network with Linux"
---

I work in a company that have an enterily MS-based network, which means,
all that domain login crap and everything that comes with it: outlook,
MS Communicator, proxies, monitoring and etc.

I particurarly hate to use MS Windows anytime, even more for work. So,
I installed an Ubuntu Linux with the windows that came in my machine.
Doing this came with some weird issues and workarounds, and this post
will describe some of them.

# Network

This was the trickiest: I needed an "GOD-mode certificate", you should
ask the domain admins for something like it. After that, the setup was
pretty easy:

# Proxy

You can either set the proxy direct on Network Proxy Setup and give the
password ten thousand times a day or use CNTLM. I strongly suggest you
to use CNTLM.

You can download it from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/files/cntlm/cntlm%200.92.3/).
Setup is a little tricky, but I will guide you. You shall have a
`/etc/cntlm.conf` file, setup the URL, domain, user and exceptions.

After that, you may have to setup the password. I recommend you to
encrypt it with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo cntlm -H -c /etc/cntlm.conf
{% endhighlight %}

Then put you root password followed by the domain password. Copy the
given hashes to the `/etc/cntlm.conf` and restart the service with
`/etc/cntlm restart`, setup your proxy as `127.0.0.1:3128` (8010
for SOCKS) and you are ready to go (remember to apply system wide):

This will fix browsing, apt and most of the things (everything that reads
`http_proxy` environment variable). You may also want to `chmod 0600` the
config file to avoid others access.


# Email

For email setup, you will probably need to call the network admin/support
to ask the addresses and ports, then, setup it in Thunderbird (my preferred
email client). After that, the setup will be easy.

The only trick I could give you here is about new message composing: Outlook
create replies putting the *new content* above the previous emails, while
Thunderbird put it bellow.

To change it, go to your account settings, and change the "Automatically quote
the original message when replaying Then," to *"start my reply above the
quote"* in the "Compositing & Addressing" tab:

# Lync / Communicator

For this -crapy- thing we have a web version available (as well as email),
but you can also setup this (if you have luck) in pidgin, using pidgin-sipe
(you can get all the needed packages from apt). You can follow [this](http://mytricks.in/2011/08/microsoft-lync-client-for-linux.html)
tutorial, skipping the installation (use apt).

I don't have luck with that, so I still with web version.

The rest work seamlessly without any tweaks. If you have any thought, please

Thanks.
