title: "Saturday hack: Upgrading Jekyll Bootstrap to upcoming Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0"
---

As you may know, this blog uses [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) as engine. Yeah, Jekyll Bootstrap uses Twitter-Bootstrap, but, it uses the version 2.0.x (mine is 2.0.4, don't remember if I update or if it hsa like this since the begin of times), and the version 2.1.0 is comming!
Like you can see in the @[twbootstrap](https://twitter.com/twbootstrap) twitter profile, 2.1.0 will be released a few days!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="pt"><p>Just a quick heads up, Bootstrap 2.1 will be released in roughly three weeks. More details to come!</p>&mdash; Twitter Bootstrap (@twbootstrap) <a href="https://twitter.com/twbootstrap/status/230470118562484224" data-datetime="2012-08-01T01:08:52+00:00">agosto 1, 2012</a></blockquote>


HELL YEAH, finally a new version!

So, today is saturday and I has nothing to do that could made the world a better place. Let's do this!

I'll describe here my 'steps' to update jekyll to the new version!

### No more talks, let's do this!

First of all, you will need the Node.js Package Manager (NPM), so, install nodejs! In my archlinux box, it was simple like that:

{% highlight sh %}
pacman -Sy nodejs
{% endhighlight %}

Then, clone the bootstrap repo somewhere:

{% highlight sh %}
git clone https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap
{% endhighlight %}

Also, let's use the correct branch!

{% highlight sh %}
git checkout 2.1.0-wip
{% endhighlight %}

Ok! Now, we have to install the dependencies to build bootstrap. According to bootstrap github project, we will need recess (a less compiler), uglify-js, and jshint. So, run this:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo npm install recess uglify-js jshint -g
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the big one! Let's make it!

{% highlight sh %}
make
{% endhighlight %}

It should provide you a output like this:

    [carlos@charmander bootstrap]$ make

    Thanks for using Bootstrap,

Hell yeah dudes! It's much more easy than I think!
So now, we have to upgrade Jekyll! Let's go?


### Upgrading Jekyll

The compiled and minified files will be at `**bootstrap home**/docs/assets`, and we will have to put them in `**jekyll home**/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap`.

So, will made it easy for you :)

#### css

* bootstrap-responsive.css
* bootstrap.css

#### js

* bootstrap.min.js

#### img

* glyphicons-halflings-white.png
* glyphicons-halflings.png

Place these files in the correct folder (like I said earlier).
Now, check your `**jekyll home**/_includes/themes/twitter/default.html` for the imports of the css and js files, check if the filename is correct, etc.

Now, you should be able to run a `jekyll --server`, in my case it works just fine, but, my layout was modified a lot... don't sure if it works in a default jekyll.
So, test it, and tell me what you got :)

I also do a lot of other hacks, using `docs.css` file as example, tweak footer, [about](/about) page and other things...

Cheers!
