title: "JPA2 with Guice"

Some time ago, I [posted here]({% post_url 2012-06-25-modular-persistence %}) about
a simple project that I've done in my post-graduation classes. Since I need it
in other projects, and also some friends ended up using it in small projects, I
decided to evolve it a little bit.

So, this is just another post (better, I hope) about [that project][1].
It's basically, a "base" for your Java projects that will somehow need to
persist data to some database (almost any app). It's baked by Guice, Guava,
EclipseLink and Apache B-Val, so, you must have almost everything you need
to get started almost instantly (you still need to add the JDBC driver).

In this post, I'll use the version **0.0.5** as base, but it should work
exactly the same way in currently **0.0.6-SNAPSHOT** version and hopefully
in further versions.

### Project creation

Create a new Maven project and add the following to your `pom.xml`:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.caarlos0</groupId>
      <version>0.0.5</version>
      <artifactId>persistence-base</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>caarlos0-releases</id>
      <url>https://github.com/caarlos0/maven/raw/master/releases</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
{% endhighlight %}

Nice, you now have almost-all needed dependencies (Guava, EclipseLink, Guice,
etc). In fact, if you run `mvn dependency:tree`, you will get something like:

{% highlight java %}

{% endhighlight %}

**HEADS UP**: Don't forget to add your database dependency and the
`persistence.xml` file.

---

### Create a model and a DAO

Just for example, I will create a very simple Person model, something like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Entity
public class Person extends Bean {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private String firstname;

  // getters, setters and etc are hidden to use less space
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that, since it extends `Bean`, the model already has an `id` and a
`version` attribute. In current SNAPSHOT, you will also have the
`TimestampedBean`, which provides `created_at` and `updated_at` attributes plus
the `id` and `version`.

---

**HEADS UP:** Don't forget to add the class to `persistence.xml` file!

---

Now, you should be able to bind a `GenericDao` for this Entity. To do that,
create some class exteding `AbstractPersistentModule`, like the following:

{% highlight java %}
public class MainModule extends AbstractPersistentModule {

  @Override
  protected void configure() {
    // 'example' is your persistence unit name
    install(new PersistenceModule("example"));

    // this is a shorthand/syntax sugar to bind a Dao<?> to GenericDao<?>
    bindGenericDaoFor(Person.class);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, in your app main class, you should be able to inject the
`GenericDao<Person>`, like the following:

{% highlight java %}
public class App {

  @Inject
  public Dao<Person> personDao;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    App app = new App();
    Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new MainModule());
    injector.injectMembers(app);

    Person p = new Person("Carlos");
    daoPerson.save(p);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Custom Dao

You will probably want to create your own `Dao` methods eventually, instead of
just use the Generic ones. You can easily achieve this by creating your own
`Dao` interface extending `Dao` and the specific `Dao` impl:

{% highlight java %}
public interface AnimalDao extends Dao<Animal> {
  void somecustomMethod(Animal a);
}

public class AnimalDaoImpl extends GenericDao<Animal> implements AnimalDao {
  public void somecustomMethod(Animal a) {
    // impl
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

**HEADS UP:** Notice that you should be able to get an `EntityManager`
instance inside any `GenericDao` specification by calling the `em()` method
from the superclass. This method relies on an `EntityManagerProvider`, avoiding
some weird session issues.

---

And, of course, you will need to bind it in your module:

{% highlight java %}
bind(AnimalDao.class).to(AnimalDaoImpl.class);
{% endhighlight %}

After that, you can simply inject it whenever you want (repecting Guice,
obviously) with:

{% highlight java %}
@Inject AnimalDao animalDao;
{% endhighlight %}

And you will be able to call `animalDao.someCustomMethod(animal)` =)

## WIP

This is a almost-infinite-work-in-progress, so, feel free to make pull-requests,
suggestions and report eventual bugs.
