Or:

> How I went from a linuxfag to just a random guy who uses unix-based
systems and drops a few jokes about how Windows sucks instead of try to
convince each and everyone to use an actual operating system.

When I first discovered Linux, I was amused. I thought _"this is great!
Why there is so few people using it?. I can change anything! I can compile
things. I command! I'm root!"_ So, young and dumb, I followed the
linuxfag tribe and started to try to convince people to use Linux instead of
Windows.

No, really, I tried to convince designers to drop Windows and Photoshop and
use Linux and Gimp instead. I don't really know why nobody beat me to death. I
would do it if I wasn't me.

After some time, I realized that it's stupid to do this. This is all politics.
Nobody gives a shit about Windows piracy (not even Microsoft). It's pretty much
like a drug dealer, but worse: they let you use it for free and make believe
that there is nothing else out there (do you parents know what an operating
system is?), then, they charge other people (or you, without you know it).

It's quite simple:

- You are taught since you're a child how to click the "Start" menu and do
things;
- You'll go study somewhere (school, college, whatever) and work somewhere;
- You'll need to use a computer;
- You don't know anything else but Windows (alongside 90% of people);
- Companies and Schools and Colleges and shit buy Windows and Office licenses;
- MS wins, without bothering you and your piracy;
- But, if you buy a laptop with Windows included, you are paying for it;
- MS wins, again, without bothering you and your piracy.

As the majority uses Windows, people will do more softwares for Windows. That's
why there is no Photoshop for Windows, for example. This is the most
fundamental concept of economics: Supply and demand. To make it even worse,
there is a concept misunderstanding (free software)
that people who use Linux doesn't like to buy things - as they seem to like
"free software", but, as fun this may sound, they believe that people
who download and install a pirate copy of Windows do - and will buy they shit.

My "Free software" argument died. People don't really care about other
stuff I do, like security, freedom, ability to change things, compatibility
with some development stuff and so on. People want it to work. People want it
easy. People want to play the last Call of Duty. They don't want to battle a
drive incompatibility error, neither learn how to use other music player, or
deal with Wine errors.

The thing is, what works for me, might not work for you. For me it's
easy to open a terminal and type commands, but not for my mother. I enjoy
learning this kind of stuff, but most of my coworkers and friend don't.

I realized that people will use what they like more, it doesn't really
matter what I say about it. The same goes about programming languages, for
instance.

So, I end this flamewar thing. The only thing I do now is a few
jokes with my coworkers and friends about how they actually need to use an
operating system to do that (whatever it is).
It's funny for me, even if most people don't get it.
Anyways, I don't care.
